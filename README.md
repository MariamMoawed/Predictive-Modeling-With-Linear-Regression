# Predictive-Modeling-With-Linear-Regression

Build a predictive model using linear regression to
predict a numerical outcome based on one or more
features. Use a dataset with a continuous target
variable

Weâ€™ll create a synthetic dataset and fit a linear regression model to predict a numerical outcome based on a single feature.
